Todo for PostGIS 1.0 compatible JDBC classes

- Testing

- WKT parsing of M and 4d geometries

- Handling of length() - esp. with modifying the geometries

- Handling of hashCode() - esp. with modifying the geometries

- Test correctness of toString() and getValue() for compatibility reasons

- See where the code can be cleaned and leaned.

- Run tests against other PostGIS releases (I did 0.8 and 1.0CVS).

- Possibly adding server side code to support plJava
