PostGIS 2.0 Migration Guide
===========================

PostGIS 2.0 introduces changes that may affect backward compatibility
for some applications. This document lists those changes.


geometry_columns
----------------

In PostGIS 2.0, the ``geometry_columns`` metadata has been changed from
a table to a view. 

  * For applications that manage ``geometry_columns``
    using the standard AddGeometryColumn() and other methods, there should
    be no change. 

  * Applications that have inserted directly into ``geometry_columns`` 
    will need to either move to the standard functions, or change
    their create table syntax to include type/srid/dimsionality
    information. 

    For example, to specify a 3D feature in WGS84::

      CREATE TABLE mytable (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        g Geometry(PointZ,4326)
      );

  * Applications reading metadata from ``geometry_columns`` should expect
    that the geometry type strings will be mixed case and include the
    dimensionality modifiers. For example: PointZM, MultiLineStringZ.
