- Clean up mapserver connectivity
- Submit to OpenGIS Consortium for testing
- Update PgSQL GiST to support row level (rectangle level?) locking.
- Network creation and network operations 
  (upstream, downstream, least cost path)
- Standardized handling for topology and coverages with 
  support functions.

======================================
Following is TODO list for release 1.1

======================================

- Full autoconf support / PG sources dependency drop

- Selectivity estimation code merge (+- pgsql-8.0.0)
	+ fix invalid stats computation (currently keeps the previously
	  computed ones, shoudl instead wipe them out - possibly a
	  pgsql bug).

- Special threatment of SRID=-1, dims=-1, type=GEOMETRY
  in geometry_columns

- Better upgrade mechanism

- Pre-8.0 port of new estimator code

- Better regression tests (single load, multi operations)

- debian packaging conf files

- shp2pgsql switch that spits out the code to create a GIST
  index on the geometric column, as requested by Christian
  Graefe.
