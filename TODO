- Clean up mapserver connectivity
- Submit to OpenGIS Consortium for testing
- Update PgSQL GiST to support row level (rectangle level?) locking.
- Network creation and network operations 
  (upstream, downstream, least cost path)
- Standardized handling for topology and coverages with 
  support functions.

======================================
Following is TODO list for release 1.1
======================================

======================================

- iconv autodetection (for already-present UTF-8 support in loader)

- Full autoconf support / PG sources dependency drop

- Selectivity estimation code merge (+- pgsql-8.0.0)
	+ fix invalid stats computation (currently keeps the previously
	  computed ones, should instead wipe them out - possibly a
	  pgsql bug).

- Special threatment of SRID=-1, dims=-1, type=GEOMETRY
  in geometry_columns

- Better upgrade mechanism

- Pre-8.0 port of new estimator code

- Better regression tests (single load, multi operations)

- debian packaging conf files

- shp2pgsql switch that spits out the code to create a GIST
  index on the geometric column, as requested by Christian
  Graefe.

- line_calculate_proportion(line, point)

    Returns a float, representing the proportional distance the
    point is located along the line.

- line_interpolate_line(geometry, proportion, direction)

    Returns a line, representing the subset of the input line
    that is the proportional distance along the line. Direction
    determines what end to measure from. (??)

- MakeValidShape() to remove consecutive vertexes and any eventual
  other cleanup aimed at making pgsql2shp produce "valid" Shapefiles.

- OGC polygon constructors
