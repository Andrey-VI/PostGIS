How to release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Date: 2006-12-15

Versioning Scheme
-----------------

Release version is composed by REL_MAJOR_VERSION, REL_MINOR_VERSION
and REL_MICRO_VERSION components.

By default only [REL_MICRO_VERSION] increments between releases.

[REL_MINOR_VERSION] is incremented (and MICRO set to 0) when minor
additions have been introduced (one or two functions can be considered
*micro* additions)

[REL_MAJOR_VERSION] is incremented (and MICRO and MINOR set to 0) when
a dump/reload of existing spatial databases is *REQUIRED* for things
to work or rather *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED* to get new functionalities.

Release procedure
-----------------

1) Update Version.config as specified in Versioning Scheme above.
2) Add a "release mark" in ChangeLog (search for '---' at the start
   of a line to see how it looks like)
3) Edit NEWS: set release date and check all notable changes are
   been reported (extract from ChangeLog).
4) Add release notes in doc/postgis.xml
5) Tag the release:
   $ base=http://svn.refractions.net/postgis/
   $ rel=MAJ.MIN.MIC
   $ svn copy -m "Tagged release $rel" $base/trunk $base/tags/$rel
6) Run: sh make_dist.sh MAJ.MIN.MIC
7) Publish
8) Announce
