The ../run_test script will load a provided shapefile using both DUMP and INSERT
mode and both WKT and WKB modes.
Will compare a 'select * from loaded_table' against the provided <name>-wkb.expected
and <name>-wkt.expected files (we need two separate files as the WKT mode will
not support M values).
Also, the tester file will dump the loaded table and compare the resulting shapefile
with the original one (only .shp, .dbf is not compared as field sizes are not
retained, we might use a dbf viewer for that, but that's not currently implemented)
