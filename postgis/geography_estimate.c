/**
 * This function will be called when the ANALYZE command is run
 * on a column of the "geography" type.
 *
 * It will need to return a stats builder function reference
 * and a "minimum" sample rows to feed it.
 * If we want analysis to be completely skipped we can return
 * FALSE and leave output vals untouched.
 *
 * What we know from this call is:
 *
 * 	o The pg_attribute row referring to the specific column.
 * 	  Could be used to get reltuples from pg_class (which
 * 	  might quite inexact though...) and use them to set an
 * 	  appropriate minimum number of sample rows to feed to
 * 	  the stats builder. The stats builder will also receive
 * 	  a more accurate "estimation" of the number or rows.
 *
 * 	o The pg_type row for the specific column.
 * 	  Could be used to set stat builder / sample rows
 * 	  based on domain type (when postgis will be implemented
 * 	  that way).
 *
 * Being this experimental we'll stick to a static stat_builder/sample_rows
 * value for now.
