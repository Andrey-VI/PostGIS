- Flatten(geometry) 

- Make collect() avoid flatting
 
- Make GEOS2POSTGIS() avoid flatting

- make IsValid() return GEOS invalidity message if any (as a NOTICE probably)

- AsBinary(geometry, XDR|NDR)

- Endiannes honouring in dumper (currently does not specify and does not
  flip when required). Depends on AsBinary() item above.

- 4d and WKB support in loader.

- box extractor function (getbox2d) returning an actual
  object should probably find a way to return NULL (for empty geometries).

- Check spheroid misure functions
	o can't understand if 3d computation works since
	  I get same result w/ 2d and 3d.
	o check if distance can be computed in 3d space

- Check semantic required by OGC functions working on "first geometry
  of a given type". Is the first geometry be to be seeked inside 
  collection elements (currently it is not w/ LWGEOM) ?

- proj support functions might need 3d sometimes.

- GEOMETRY && BOX2D, GEOMETRY && BOX3D
