These are extension modules for PostgreQL 9.1
to allow postgis modules
to be installed using standard PostgreSQL 9.1+
CREATE EXTENSION syntax

To use: first make install regular PostGIS.
These should automatically get installed in share/extension folder of
PostGIS if you compiled against PostgreSQL 9.1

Then in your PostgreSQL database run
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;


The dependency logic should warn if you try
to install postgis_topology without postgis
or try to drop postgis without first droping postgis_topology.

You will also not be able to drop any postgis functions installed by the extension.
