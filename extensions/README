These are extension modules for PostgreQL 9.1
to allow postgis modules
to be installed using standard PostgreSQL 9.1+
CREATE EXTENSION syntax

To use: first make install regular PostGIS
then do the below for each extension

make 
make install 

each

Then in your PostgreSQL database run
CREATE EXTENSION postgis_core;
CREATE EXTENSION postgis_raster;

-- this one doesn't seem to work 
-- gives a weird error 
-- can not drop table topology.pg_temp_777...
CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;

Known issue:
make install for some reason gives an erro though 
it does correctly install the modules making them available.

Do uninstall you have to drop cascade the extension
which is not ideal but working out the cast issues.

The dependency logic should warn if you try
to install postgis_raster without postgis_core, 
but that seems to not be working right
thought drop cascade extension postgis_core drops
postgis_raster extension.
