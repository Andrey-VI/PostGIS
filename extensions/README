These are extension modules for PostgreQL 9.1
to allow postgis modules
to be installed using standard PostgreSQL 9.1+
CREATE EXTENSION syntax

To use: first make install regular PostGIS.  Also make sure to make the comments
if you are building from teh source repository
since the extensions package the postgis function descriptions.
make comments

Makign the comments is not necessary if you are building 
from the tar balls since the tar balls have 
the various postgis_comments.sql, topology_comments.sql, 
and raster_comments.sql already built.

Then:
cd extensions/postgis
make install
cd ..
cd extensions/postgis_topology
make install

These should automatically get installed in share/extension folder of
PostgreSQL 9.1.

Then in your PostgreSQL database run
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;


The dependency logic should warn if you try
to install postgis_topology without postgis
or try to drop postgis without first droping postgis_topology.

You will also not be able to drop any postgis functions installed by the extension.
If you want to manually install the extensions from one server to another
, just copy over the

extensions/postgis: postgis.control, sql/*
extension/postgis_topoloyg postgis_topology.control,sql/* 

files into your PostgreSQL/share/extension folder.
