INSTALLING The Tiger Geocoder
This is a customized version of Steve Frost's tiger geocoder revisions (http://www.snowman.net/git/tiger_geocoder/).  
This version includes a loader that is portable between Linux and Windows but loads a full state of data.  The loader helper tables
and functions are prefixed with loader and stored in the tiger schema.  If you only want to load a county, then
revise the wget call that is generated for the state to just download the state wide and specific counties or just download them by hand.  The loader will only
process files that exist.

If you are on windows -- you will need 7zip and wget.
7zip you can get from http://www.7-zip.org/  and wget you can get from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm

Steps to install and load:
1.  Create a PostGIS enabled db if you don't have one already
2.	From command line, cd into the tiger_geocoder_2010 folder
3.  Edit the tiger_loader.sql to the paths of your executables server etc.
4.	Edit the create_geocode.bat or create_geocode.sh and run
(NOTE: if you installed soundex in its own schema -- you will need to add it to the set path of the create_geocode.sql file
and also have it in the search_path of your database)

5.	Now add tiger schema to your database search path by doing something like 
ALTER DATABASE geocoder SET search_path=public, tiger;
6.	Create a folder called gisdata on root of server or your local pc if you have a fast network connection to the server this is where the tiger files will be downloaded to.  
7. Create a folder called temp in the gisdata folder.  This will be the folder where we extract the downloaded tiger data.


8. Run this command at psql or pgAdmin III query window to generate the script.  
Replacing 'DC', 'RI'  with list of states you want and save contents to a .bat or sh file in the gisdata folder you created.

This will generate a script for each state
--To generate a windows script
SELECT loader_generate_script(ARRAY['DC','RI'], 'windows');

If you script disappears without loading anything, most likely one of your path settings is wrong.  To troubleshoot run the batch script by 
first opening up a commandline and executing the file.

That will keep the window open for you to see the error.

--To generate a linux script (We haven't tested the linux script yet so may need some changes)
SELECT loader_generate_script(ARRAY['DC','RI'], 'sh');



9. Copy and paste the generated script into a .bat or .sh file and put in gisdata folder you created and then run it.

10. Test out the geocoder run this query

SELECT g.rating, 
	ST_X(geomout) As lon, 
	ST_Y(geomout) As lat, (addy).* 
FROM geocode('1731 New Hampshire Avenue Northwest, Washington, DC 20010') As g;

Steps to upgrade your install:
If you need to upgrade the geocoder/tiger loader from a pre-release 2.0.0 install -- run the upgrade_geocoder.sh or upgrade_geocoder.bat script.
CAUTION: The upgrade script will drop any table columns that have a norm_addy type for a column type.  This is rare if ever done so you should be fine.
We plan to fix this later. It will also drop any customizations you have made to the tiger_loader configuration tables.
