TIGER Geocoder

  2004/10/28

  A plpgsql based geocoder written for TIGER census data.

Installation instructions:

- If the database being used is new, ensure the following scripts have 
  been loaded:

	/opt/pgsql74/share/postgis.sql
	/opt/pgsql74/share/contrib/spatial_ref_sys.sql

- Load the fuzzy string matching functions.  These must first be compiled, 
  and may be found in the contrib directory of the postgres source directory.

	psql [-p (port)] (database) < /usr/local/src/postgresql-7.4.5/contrib/fuzzystrmatch/fuzzystrmatch.sql

- Ensure that the TIGER data is loaded into the target database.

- Load the lookup tables.  This creates the lookup tables and loads predefined
  data into them.  If the standardized TIGER data is not being used, this 
  script will need to be altered to reflect the actual data.  Since the place
  and countysub lookup tables are generated to reflect the data in use, the
  database must be populated before this script is run.  Indicies are also
  created in this script.

	psql [-p (port)] (database) < lookup_tables.sql

- Load the function scripts.  This script loads the geocode function, and all
  support modules and functions required by it.

	psql [-p (port)] (database) < tiger_geocoder.sql
